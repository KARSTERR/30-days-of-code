Welcome to my **30 Days of Code** challenge repository! This project contains solutions to the HackerRank challenge, where I tackle a new problem every day to improve my C++ skills and enhance my problem-solving abilities.

---

## Repository Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- **DayXX/**: Each folder contains a solution for that day's challenge (e.g., `main.cpp`), along with any relevant test files.
- Well-organized for easy navigation and understanding.

---

## How to Use üñ•Ô∏è

1. Navigate to a specific day's folder.
2. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o dayXX
   ./dayXX
   ```

Enjoy the challenge and keep coding! üéØ
